## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

This was a good chance for me to practice a little bit of React. Other than creating two separate components for the results and the summary, I got to have a go at using data from a JSON file to dynamically populate the result categories.

### Continued development

One thing I struggled to do was get the images to display by referencing their paths as they appear in the JSON file. When files from the assets folder are imported into any of the JSX files, Vite gives them hashed names in the build version. I don't think this works when a file path is referenced directly as a string. Vite's documentation has useful information and advice about this. I'll try that next time I need to import/reference local files.

- [How to Set backgroundImage with Inline CSS Style](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-background-image-tutorial-how-to-set-backgroundimage-with-inline-css-style/) - This came in handy when I was trying to figure out how to use `background-image` in a style tag. I forgot about the camelCase thing. ðŸ™„
